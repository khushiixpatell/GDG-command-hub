- Chosen Writing Style: "${style || "emoji"}" (Format styles: 'emoji' = highly interactive with fun tech emoji list bullets, 'formal' = professional university alert, 'casual' = peer-to-peer student focus)

Guidelines:
1. Leverage Discord's native markdown elements:
   - Use bold (**text**) for important items.
   - Use structural subtitles or headers (e.g. ### 🚀 Event Highlights) to divide sections.
   - Use lists and bullet symbols elegantly to prevent text-walls.
   - Include a code-block highlighting key details (e.g.
     \`\`\`text
     Date: ${date || "TBD"}
     Platform: GDG Community Platform
     \`\`\`
     ) so that it stands out beautifully on mobile and desktop views.
2. Formulate 2-3 visual reaction suggestions to drive community interaction (e.g. "React with :fire: if you are ready!").
3. Include standard role tag placeholder at the top (e.g., "@everyone", "@here") based on the topic importance.
4. Conclude with an RSVP call-to-action link placeholder (e.g. [RSVP here to secure badging!]).

Write a complete, ready-to-use template. Keep it punchy, enthusiastic, and strictly under 1500 characters so it fits comfortably within Discord's payload limits.`;
